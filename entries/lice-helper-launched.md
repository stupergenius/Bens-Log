title: Lice Helper Launched
---

Recently finished and launched a new website for a client. The website
advertises a lice removal service and provides means for potential
customers to learn about the service and get in touch with the business
quickly and easily. [Lice Helper](http://www.licehelper.com/) The site
is built on a CakePHP application and actually uses Wordpress for the
blog section of the site. It doesn't use Wordpress for any of the front
end, but in the back end the standard Wordpress Dashboard is used to
manage, edit, and write blog posts that are then displayed in the front
end blog section. The site also utilizes my meta description and title
components, that allow the application to manage those parts of the page
independently of the page content. Basically it just ties a URL to a
title or a description, matches them up when pages are requested, and if
it finds a matching record it outputs it in the proper place. Otherwise
it will output a sensible default text. I did enjoy working with CakePHP
again as it's been some time. But all the things I liked about it still
apply. It's still lightening fast from prototype to finished site, and
design modifications couldn't be any simpler. All in all, good project,
and I think the end result looks and works very well.
