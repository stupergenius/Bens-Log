---

In this series of posts I will be review my experience at the [2011 Ohio
LinuxFest](https://ohiolinux.org/). I will be giving my opinions and
what I learned at the talks. Overall it was a very good day of talks,
and I'm always impressed at how well organized this **free** convention
is every year.

I will update this post with links to specific articles, and they will
all be tagged with OLF2011.
