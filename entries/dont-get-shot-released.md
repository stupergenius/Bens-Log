![Don't Get Shot](http://media.bensnider.com/images/dgs_snap1.png)

The minigame I've been working on at my [day job](http://ournewgame.com)
has been released, play ["Don't Get
Shot"](http://www.kongregate.com/games/OurNewGame/dont-get-shot-issue-1?referrer=OurNewGame)
free at Kongregate. This minigame is released in support of the release
of the [first issue of Exile](http://ournewgame.com/buy-exile/).

The game is a reversal on the popular top down shmup genre, in that you
are the one getting shot at. It is your goal to not get shot, or
exploded, and progress through the levels. The level names I find
entertaining and they typically give you a hint as to what to expect in
the level.

The game was made with the excellent [Flixel](http://flixel.org/) and
[Box2D](http://box2dflash.sourceforge.net/) libraries. It is a
successful hybrid between the two, leveraging the Flixel framework for
its great sprite animation, state management, and quick rendering, while
using the accurate physics and collision features of the Box2D project.
The integration was actually a great deal simpler than I thought it was
going to be, which is like icing on the cake given all the features now
available. These features coupled with a simple editor and an xml level
format made it easy to turn out lots of great levels, which you can look
forward to in future issue releases.

The game's artwork was done by [Dave
Will](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-will/8/688/451), the original
concept was created by [Ran
Flasterstein](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ranflash), and the levels were
done by [Jay Treuhaft](http://www.jaytreuhaft.com/) and Fred Dinovo.
