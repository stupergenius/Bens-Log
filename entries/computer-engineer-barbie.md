A coworker writes me saying:

> Please take a moment to vote for Barbie to become a Computer Engineer.
> Future generations of computer engineers would really appreciate it if
> we could influence some girls to take up the profession.

So indeed, I did vote, and so should you....or else! From the Barbie
site:

> Computer engineers have lots of different specialties. They can do
> anything from building computers to making video games!

It's true folks. Why would any young girl not want a computer engineer
Barbie? It's fun for the whole family! I certainly wish my toys could
program an [analog
synthesizer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_synthesizer).
