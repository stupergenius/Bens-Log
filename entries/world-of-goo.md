title: World of Goo
---

Not often do I write personally here outside of programming, but I must
make an exception for World of Goo. It's a game unlike anything else
really, maybe a little like the [Fantastic
Contraption](http://fantasticcontraption.com/) flash game in that they
are both logic puzzles. Otherwise it's a great unique game in which you
can lose yourself. [Try the

or [get more information](http://www.theworldofgoo.com/).
