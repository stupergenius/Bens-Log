title: Refocusing On Open Source Swift
---

I have finally decided to take up blogging here again. After some life
changes, a new job and a big move, I figured it was about time to tickle
the plastics again. And yes you can look forward to many more bad jokes
(and sentences starting with conjunctions, [this
site](http://www.getitwriteonline.com/archive/032601startsentandbut.htm)
says it's OK though).

In the process, I'm refocusing the blog from a general programming blog,
to a more specialized blog. The topics I'll be writing about will be
centered around Apple's [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
language, particularly the parts of the language and standard library
that will be [open
sourced](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=29) in the
(hopefully very) near future. In the meantime I'll write about using
Swift as a general purpose language: not just Swift in iOS or Mac OS.

So hold tight and I'll get some new content up in here.
