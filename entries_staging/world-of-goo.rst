Not often do I write personally here outside of programming, but I must
make an exception for World of Goo. It's a game unlike anything else
really, maybe a little like the `Fantastic Contraption`_ flash game in
that they are both logic puzzles. Otherwise it's a great unique game in
which you can lose yourself. `Try the demo`_ or `get more information`_.
