Copying a Flash MovieClip, or The Flash Holy Grail

Ran into a nice solution for copying arbitrary MovieClips at runtime
today. I am designing a spot the difference game akin to `6
Differences`_ with the requirement that, upon finding a difference, the
scene should go to the "correct" state depending on which difference was
defined as master, among a few other criterion. This required that I
somehow duplicate, as much as is possible, the state of the "master"
difference, when appropriate. At any rate, the solution comes from
`Danny Burbol's blog`_, which apparently came from a `Experts Exchange
thread`_ (damn people charging for information). I modified the solution
a bit to fit my needs, but not by a whole lot. Sometimes I only need to
copy the instance and I can reconstitute the MovieClip from there but
other times I will need to get the whole shebang. It's pretty handy in
general. So my version follows (as a bonus I include my handy-dandy
clearAllChildren function):

.. code:: actionscript

    package com.bmm.utils {
      import flash.display.DisplayObject;
      import flash.display.DisplayObjectContainer;
      import flash.geom.Rectangle;
      
      /**
       * ...
       * @author BenS
       */
      public class UIUtils {
        
        public static function clearAllChildren(c:DisplayObjectContainer):void {
          if (c == null || c.numChildren == 0) return;
          
          var i:int = 0, n:int = c.numChildren;
          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            c.removeChildAt(0);
          }
        }
        
        public static function simpleDisplayObjectClone(source:DisplayObject):DisplayObject {
          var cc:Class = Object(source).constructor;
          return new cc();
        }
        
        public static function displayObjectClone(source:DisplayObject):DisplayObject {
          var copy:DisplayObject = UIUtils.simpleDisplayObjectClone(source);
          
          copy.transform = source.transform;
          copy.filters = source.filters;
          copy.cacheAsBitmap = source.cacheAsBitmap;
          copy.opaqueBackground = source.opaqueBackground;
          if (source.scale9Grid) {
            var r:Rectangle = source.scale9Grid;
            copy.scale9Grid = r;
          }
          
          return copy;
        }
      }
    }
