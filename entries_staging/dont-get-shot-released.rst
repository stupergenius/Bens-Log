The minigame I've been working on at my `day job`_ has been released,
play `"Don't Get Shot"`_ free at Kongregate. This minigame is released
in support of the release of the `first issue of Exile`_.

The game is a reversal on the popular top down shmup genre, in that you
are the one getting shot at. It is your goal to not get shot, or
exploded, and progress through the levels. The level names I find
entertaining and they typically give you a hint as to what to expect in
the level.

The game was made with the excellent `Flixel`_ and `Box2D`_ libraries.
It is a successful hybrid between the two, leveraging the Flixel
framework for its great sprite animation, state management, and quick
rendering, while using the accurate physics and collision features of
the Box2D project. The integration was actually a great deal simpler
than I thought it was going to be, which is like icing on the cake given
all the features now available. These features coupled with a simple
editor and an xml level format made it easy to turn out lots of great
levels, which you can look forward to in future issue releases.

The game's artwork was done by `Dave Will`_, the original concept was
created by `Ran Flasterstein`_, and the levels were done by `Jay
Treuhaft`_ and Fred Dinovo.
