A coworker writes me saying:

    Please take a moment to vote for Barbie to become a Computer
    Engineer. Future generations of computer engineers would really
    appreciate it if we could influence some girls to take up the
    profession.

So indeed, I did vote, and so should you....or else! From the Barbie
site:

    Computer engineers have lots of different specialties. They can do
    anything from building computers to making video games!

It's true folks. Why would any young girl not want a computer engineer
Barbie? It's fun for the whole family! I certainly wish my toys could
program an `analog synthesizer`_. `Vote!`_
