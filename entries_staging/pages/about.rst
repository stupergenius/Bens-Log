I'm an iOS developer by trade, and otherwise identify as a husband, cyclist, vegan and nerd. Technology is my life, and mobile technology is where I choose direct my focus. Mobile technology is how the world interacts, and so being at the forefront of this trend is equal parts challenging and rewarding.

I'm not currently looking for work, but I always welcome connections.
