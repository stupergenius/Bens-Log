I have finally decided to take up blogging here again. After some life changes, a new job and a big move, I figured it was about time to tickle the plastics again. And yes you can look forward to many more bad jokes (and sentences starting with conjunctions, `this site`_ says it's OK though).

In the process, I'm refocusing the blog from a general programming blog, to a more specialized blog. The topics I'll be writing about will be centered around Apple's `Swift`_ language, particularly the parts of the language and standard library that will be `open sourced`_ in the (hopefully very) near future. In the meantime I'll write about using Swift as a general purpose language: not just Swift in iOS or Mac OS.

So hold tight and I'll get some new content up in here.
