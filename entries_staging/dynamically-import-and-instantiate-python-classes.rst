Dynamically Import and Instantiate Python Classes

Ran into this bit of genius code in the `python mailing list`_. Here's
the code for now and I'll explain it later:

.. code:: python

    def forname(modname, classname):
        ''' Returns a class of "classname" from module "modname". '''
        module = __import__(modname)
        classobj = getattr(module, classname)
        return classobj

Basically it returns a class object from modname matching classname.
Sound decptively simple, and it is. If it doesn't find classname in
modname, or it doesn't find modname, it will simply throw an import
error. What's left to do is just instantiate an object of that class and
shazam, its magic. Here's an example to create a new Popen instance:

.. code:: python

    p_class = forname("subprocess", "Popen")
    p_inst = p_class(["ls", "-l"])

It's useful for getting input from a file or user and creating classes
based on that input. Of course, be certain to properly validate that
input, or it can get really nasty really quickly.
