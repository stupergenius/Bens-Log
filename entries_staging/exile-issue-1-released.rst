The game I've been working on at my `day job`_ has been released. The
`first issue of Exile`_ is available today, and if you order now for $8
you get the remaining 3 issues delivered digitally when they are
released.

Exile is unlike most games and most graphic novels, in that it offers
first rate art and story with a compelling interface including
interactivity, a soundtrack, and sound effects. We've also put a lot of
effort into making the game as immersive as possible by providing
unlockable elements within the game that give players a look at concept
art, character sketches, and even minigames set in the Exile universe.
The end result is a unique experience and the game succeeds in blurring
the line between graphic novels and video games.

I've been lucky to work with a great team of artists and writers on this
game, and I couldn't be happier with the way this has turned out.
