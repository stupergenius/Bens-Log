CakePHP Tree Find By Path

Wrote these little functions to help with finding tree nodes by
specifying a path of values. For example if we had a tree of categories
with similar names like TVs->Color and Movies->Color, we can't find by
the category name since its not unique, but we can search by pathing
like tvs/color or movies/color. So to this end is this model code:

.. code:: php

    function findPath($paths, $fieldName) {
        $root = $this->find('threaded');
        return $this->findPathHelper($root, $paths, $fieldName);
    }

    function findPathHelper($node, $paths, $fieldName) {
        // search for paths from the beginning of the list
        $path = array_shift($paths);
        $newNode = false;
        // looking for the current path in the specified field
        foreach ($node as $nodeNode) {
            if ($nodeNode[$this->name][$fieldName] == $path) {
                $newNode = $nodeNode;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (empty($paths) || $newNode === false) {
            // done processing the paths, or cannot find a matching node
            return $newNode;
        } else {
            // not done, find based on the found node's children
            return $this->findPathHelper($newNode['children'], $paths, $fieldName);
        }
    }

And we can use it from our controller like:

.. code:: php

    $category = $this->Category->findPath(array('tv', 'color'), 'name');

Probably not the most efficient code, but it sure is elegant. It also
will probably break if you have two rows on the same level with the same
name, but that would be pointless anyway.
