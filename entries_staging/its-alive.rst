*Finally* got the new blog up and running. But I feel like I've learned
a lot about modern python development (github, pip, virtualenv, etc.),
which was the main impetus behind doing this conversion.

This blog is now a static site that's generated using Pelican_, stored
on my `GitHub repository`_ and served up through my Amazon S3 bucket that
I just point my domain at. Ideally I will automate this to the point
that a git commit will trigger a Pelican build and then a s3cmd.rb_
script that syncs up the generated files. Not sure if I want to make
that one or two steps though.

But, expect more to come of this!
