Recently finished and launched a new website for a client. The website
advertises a lice removal service and provides means for potential
customers to learn about the service and get in touch with the business
quickly and easily. `Lice Helper`_ The site is built on a CakePHP
application and actually uses Wordpress for the blog section of the
site. It doesn't use Wordpress for any of the front end, but in the back
end the standard Wordpress Dashboard is used to manage, edit, and write
blog posts that are then displayed in the front end blog section. The
site also utilizes my meta description and title components, that allow
the application to manage those parts of the page independently of the
page content. Basically it just ties a URL to a title or a description,
matches them up when pages are requested, and if it finds a matching
record it outputs it in the proper place. Otherwise it will output a
sensible default text. I did enjoy working with CakePHP again as it's
been some time. But all the things I liked about it still apply. It's
still lightening fast from prototype to finished site, and design
modifications couldn't be any simpler. All in all, good project, and I
think the end result looks and works very well.
